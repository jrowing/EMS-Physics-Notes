# EMS Physics Notes

## Preamble:
These notes are produced for EMS students - they are suitable for any A-Level Physics course, though they have been tailored to suit the EDUQAS specification along with lots of off-piste ramblings.
There are no answers to the questions at the end of chapter (yet - perhaps you could contribute some?)
## Notes
All separate .tex files for each individual chapter are found here.
