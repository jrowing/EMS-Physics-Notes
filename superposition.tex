\section{Superposition of Waves}

When two of more waves meet together, the resultant motion is a combination of the individuals. They can form a \emph{resultant wave} when they overlap, after which they cross one another and neither is affected. In this chapter, we will study the principle of superposition, and look at two important consequences: the phenomenon of \emph{interference} and \emph{stationary waves}.

\subsection{Superposition of waves}



\subsection{Principle of superposition}

\begin{ilight}
	 When two (or more) waves meet to form a resultant wave, the \keypoint{principle of superposition} states that the resultant displacement is the vector sum of each individual displacement\index{superposition of waves!principle of superposition}
\end{ilight}

\example{Displacementâ€“time graphs for two waves $A$ and $B$ meeting at some point, together with the resultant wave formed at that point.}

Two important situations are constructive superposition and destructive superposition\index{superposition of waves!constructive superposition}\index{superposition of waves!destructive superposition}

\keypoint{Constructive superposition} occurs when resultant wave has greatest possible amplitude. This happens when peaks of the two waves meet together (also trough meets trough)\footnote{This statement is implicitly for transverse waves. For longitudinal waves to superpose constructively, the regions of compression (or rarefaction) must overlap.} 	peaks of both waves must arrive with a time difference $\Delta t = 0, \, T, \, 2T, \cdots$
	
\keypoint{Destructive superposition} occurs when amplitudes of each wave cancel out one another this happens when peak of one wave overlaps with trough of the other wave peaks of both waves must arrive with a time difference $\Delta t = \frac{1}{2}T, \, \frac{3}{2}T, \, \frac{5}{2}T, \cdots$

\subsection{Path difference}

The \keypoint{path difference}\index{path difference} is the difference in distance that two waves must travel from their sources to a given point. It plays a crucial role in wave interference, where waves can either constructively or destructively superpose depending on their path difference. Path difference is generally expressed in multiples of wavelength. To tell whether two waves superpose constructively or destructively:

	if ${\Delta L = 0, \, \lambda, \, 2\lambda, \cdots}$, then superposition is constructive
	
	if ${\Delta L = \frac{\lambda}{2}, \, \frac{3\lambda}{2}, \, \frac{5\lambda}{2}, \cdots}$, then superposition is destructive
	
\end{tcolorbox}\vspace*{-4pt}

\example{Two loudspeakers are wired to produce identical sound signals in unison. The sound wave produced has a wavelength of 80 cm. Describe the volume you hear when you are at a distance of (a) 10 m from both speakers, (b) 10 m from one speaker and 12 m from the other?}

\begin{soln} path difference for case (a): $\Delta L = 10 - 10  = 0$

so constructive superposition, resultant amplitude is large, a loud sound is heard

path difference for case (b): $\Delta L = 12 - 10 = 2.0 \text{ m} \RA \Delta L = \frac{5}{2}\lambda$

so destructive superposition, resultant amplitude is small, sound is quiet \end{soln}

\subsection{Phase difference}

When two waves or two vibrating particles are compared, it is also useful to describe how much one is out of step with the other in terms of their \keypoint{phase difference}\index{phase difference} ($\Delta \phi$)
\footnote{More logically, we should first define the notion of \emph{phase angle} before talking about the \emph{phase difference}, which is simply the difference between the phase angles of two waves.
	
	Wave motion can generally be described by sine (or cosine) functions. Since the initial displacement of a wave is not necessarily zero, one can introduce a constant term that appears in the argument of the sine function. This term shifts the origin of the sine, and we call that the \emph{phase angle} $\phi$ of the wave, measured in radians (or degrees). One can think of $\phi$ as a number giving the fraction in a complete oscillation.
	
	In particular, the displacement $y$ of a transverse wave along the direction $x$ of energy transfer can be given by: $y = A \sin\left( \frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} - \frac{2\pi t}{T} + \phi \right)$. You can verify that this indeed describes a sinusoidal wave of wavelength $\lambda$ and period $T$ travelling at speed $v = \frac{\lambda}{T}$, while $\phi$ determines when and where the peaks show up.}

Phase difference is measured in radians (rad) or degrees ($^\circ$),  if two waves have a phase difference $\Delta \phi = 0,2\pi,4\pi,\cdots$, the two waves are said to be \keypoint{in phase}\footnote{If $\Delta \phi$ is given in degrees, then two waves are in phase if $\Delta \phi = 0, \, 360^\circ, \, 720^\circ, \cdots$}. In this case, peak of one wave overlaps with peak of the other. If two waves are not in phase, then they are said to be \keypoint{out of phase}
If $\Delta \phi = \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi, \cdots$, then two waves are completely out of phase, or \keypoint{anti-phase}\footnote{If $\Delta \phi$ is given in degrees, then two waves are anti-phase if $\Delta \phi = 180^\circ, \, 540^\circ, \, 900^\circ, \cdots$} in this case, peak of one wave meets the trough of the other. 

We can tell whether two waves superpose constructively or destructively from their phase difference as follows:

		if ${\Delta \phi = 0, \, 2\pi, \,4\pi, \cdots}$, then superposition is constructive
		
		if ${\Delta \phi = \pi, \, 3\pi, \, 5\pi, \cdots}$, then superposition is destructive
		
	\end{tcolorbox}\vspace*{-4pt}
	
}






\newpage

Phase difference can also be related to path difference by: \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{ \frac{\Delta \phi}{2\pi} = \frac{\Delta L}{\lambda} = \frac{\Delta t}{T} } \end{empheq}

\example{The diagrams below each shows the displacement of a particular point in two transverse waves. If both waves are travelling in the same direction with a wavelength of 30 cm, what is the phase difference and path difference between each wave?}

\subsection*{Brief summary}

The conditions for constructive and destructive superposition can be summarised as follows:

\begin{center}
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	& constructive superposition & destructive superposition \\
	\hline
	simple criteria & peak meets peak & peak meets trough \\
	\hline
	time difference & $\Delta t = n \cdot T$ & $\Delta t = \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot T$ \\
	\hline
	path difference & $\Delta L = n \cdot \lambda$ & $\Delta L = \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot \lambda$ \\
	\hline
	phase difference & $\Delta \phi = n\cdot 2\pi\,$ or $\,n\cdot 360^\circ$ & $\Delta \phi = \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\cdot 2\pi \,$ or $\,\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\cdot 360^\circ$ \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\end{center}

where $n$ is a whole number: $n=0, 1, 2, 3 \cdots$

Remember that $\Delta t$, $\Delta L$ and $\Delta \phi$ are just different ways to describe how much one wave is ahead of/lag behind another wave, so they must be closely interrelated to each other.

\subsection{Interference}

When two (or more) waves of constant phase difference meet, stable regions of constructive and destructive superposition are produced alternately, this phenomenon is called \keypoint{interference}\index{interference}



\begin{figure*}[htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{interference.pdf}
\caption{constructive (solid lines) and destructive (dashed lines) interference of waves produced from two coherent sources $A$ and $B$}
\end{figure*}
\vspace{1cm}
Regions of constructive interference are often called \emph{maxima}

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] points on line C$_0$ are of equal distance to wave sources, i.e., path difference $\Delta L = 0$
	
	so maxima are observed along C$_0$
	
	\item[--] points on C$_1$, C$_2$ and C$_3$ have path difference $\Delta L = \lambda, \, 2\lambda, \, 3\lambda$
	
	so maxima are also formed along C$_1$, C$_2$ and C$_3$
	
	\item[--] equivalently, points on C$_n$ have phase difference $\Delta \phi = n\cdot 2\pi$, where $n=0,1,2,3,\cdots$
\end{compactitem} 

Regions of destructive interference are often called \emph{minima}

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] points on D$_1$, D$_2$ and D$_3$ have path difference $\Delta L = \frac{1}{2}\lambda, \, \frac{3}{2}\lambda, \, \frac{5}{2}\lambda$
	
	so maxima are also formed along D$_1$, D$_2$ and D$_3$
	
	\item[--] similarly, points on D$_n$ have phase difference $\Delta \phi = \left( n+\frac{1}{2} \right) \cdot 2\pi$, where $n=1,2,3,\cdots$
\end{compactitem} 






\newpage


Stable interference means regions of maxima/minima remain maxima/minima can be easily seen. This requires \keypoint{coherent} wave sources, which means constant phase difference over time\index{coherence}.

The easiest way to produce coherent waves is to use the the same source, such as

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] dippers driven by a common vibrating beam in a ripple tank
	
	\item[--] loudspeakers driven by the same signal generator
 \item[--] a laser beam shone on two slits.

Conversely, we do not see interference from beams of light from different lamps or laser sources because light from different sources are usually \emph{incoherent}\footnote{Emission of light is associated with the electronic transitions between energy levels in an atom, which is a completely random process. So in general separate light sources are not coherent.}

This can be overcome by dividing a single beam into several beams using a number of slits. common apparatuses of doing so are the \emph{double-slit} and \emph{diffraction gratings}

\example{Two coherent waves meet in space, one of which has an amplitude of 0.30 cm and the other of 0.20 cm. How does the intensity of maxima compare with the intensity of minima?}

\begin{soln} Amplitude of maxima: $A_\tmax = A_1 + A_2 = 0.30 + 0.20 = 0.50 \text{ cm}$

Amplitude of minima: $A_\tmin = A_1 - A_2 = 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.10 \text{ cm}$

Ratio of intensities: $\frac{I_\tmax}{I_\tmin} = \left( \frac{A_\tmax}{A_\tmin} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{0.50}{0.10} \right)^2 \RA \frac{I_\tmax}{I_\tmin} = 25$ \end{soln}

\subsection{Double-slit interference}\index{double-slit experiement}

Let's take a beam of light being guided through two narrow slits, light waves diffracting through the slits act as coherent wave sources and when they meet on a screen, interference pattern can be seen. Since this experiment is carried out with light, alternating bright and dark fringes are formed. 

This is known as \emph{Thomas Young}'s \keypoint{double-slit experiment}
\footnote[][-4cm]{The nature of light has been argued since the history of human civilisation. It has been long debated whether light is a \emph{wave} or it is made of \emph{particles}. It was until the early 1800s when Thomas Young carried out the famous double-slit experiment that now bears his name, people became certain that light has wavelike properties. We know now of course that it has particle -like properties too. For a detailed review, check out the Wikipedia article: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light}.}

When waves from the two slits meet with path difference $\Delta L = \frac{1}{2}\lambda, \, \frac{3}{2}\lambda, \, \frac{5}{2}\lambda, \cdots$, minima is formed, ie dark fringes are observed.

We can use the geometry of the slit separation, the distance to the screen, and the spacing of the fringes to calculate the wavelength of the light - at least we can if the slit-to-screen distance is much larger than the slit separation, i.e., $D \gg d$.\\

In this case, bright fringes are nearly equally spaced with a separation of: \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{x = \frac{\lambda D}{d}}\end{empheq}

where $d$ is separation of the two slits, $D$ is slit-to-screen distance

 \caption{Deriving the Young slits formulae.}
\end{figure*}

The derivation of this formulae is one you should know and follows: 
Consider a point $P$ on the screen where a bright fringe is formed (see figure \ref{fringey})

The path difference between the slits must be a whole number of wavelength: $$ \Delta L = \big|PB-PA\big| = n\lambda $$

Because $D \gg d$, paths $PA$ and $PB$ can be considered approximately parallel, so path difference is length of the segment $HB$, then we have: $$\Delta L \approx d\sin\theta$$

In terms of $\theta$, bright fringes are found where: $$ d\sin\theta = n\lambda $$

To convert $\theta$ into the coordinate $y$, we have: $$\tan \theta = \frac{y}{D}$$

Because $\theta$ is very small, the small-angle approximation ($\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta$) can be applied, so positions where the bright fringes show up are: $$ \tcbhighmath{y_n =  n \times \frac{\lambda D}{d}} $$\begin{marginfigure}

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

\caption{For small values of x, tan(x) [red] and sin(x) [blue] can be considered equal.} 
\end{marginfigure}


Here the coordinate subscript $n$ labels the order of the bright fringes. This shows that the $(n+1)$-th fringe is at a fixed distance from the $n$-th fringe, therefore the separation between neighbouring bright fringes is: $$ {x=\frac{\lambda D}{d}} $$

Aaltering width of slit could cause a change in \emph{brightness} of fringes.

\example{A teacher demonstrates the double-slit experiment with a beam of red light produced from a helium-neon laser. The beam of wavelength of 632 nm is sent through a double-slit separated by 0.30 mm and passed onto a wall at about 2.0 m from the slits. (a) What is the fringe separation? (b) If the experiment is carried out using a green laser, what changes do you expect?}

\begin{soln} Fringe separation: $ x = \frac{\lambda D}{d} = \frac{632 \times 10^{-9} \times 2.0 }{0.30 \times 10^{-3}} \RA x \approx 4.2 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}$

if replaced by green light, wavelength becomes shorter, so smaller fringe separation \end{soln}


\example{Coherent light passes through a double slit. Initially, the light intensity from each slit is the same. State the change to the appearance of the fringes if (a) the separation between the slits is increased, (b) The width of one of the slits is reduced.}

\begin{soln} (a) From $ x = \frac{\lambda D}{d} $, shorter $\lambda$ results in smaller fringe separation

\hspace*{1.25em} but brightness of the fringes remains unchanged

(b) Reducing width of slit causes amplitude of light from that slit to decrease

\hspace*{1.25em} at maxima, resultant amplitude decreases, so bright fringes become less bright

\hspace*{1.25em} at minima, amplitudes do not cancel completely, so dark fringes become a bit brighter

\hspace*{1.25em} but no change to separation between fringes \end{soln}



\subsection{Multi-slit interference: diffraction gratings}

Passing light through even more slits also produces nice interference patterns, the \keypoint{diffraction grating} is such an apparatus, with hundreds or thousands of slits per mm\index{diffraction grating}

Compared to double-slit, maxima produced by diffraction grating are \emph{sharper} and \emph{brighter}, maxima are formed when waves from not two but many slits interfere constructively. The location of each maxima from a diffraction grating is given by: \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{d \sin \theta = n\lambda}\end{empheq}

where $d$ is the separation between adjacent slits, and light is incident \emph{normally}.

You do not need to be able to reproduce this derivation, but it is offered here in contrast to the above. For constructive interference, path difference between adjacent slits must satisfy: $\Delta L = n\lambda $. Since slits are so close together, we consider the light rays passing through the slits are nearly parallel. Using the same small angle trick as before, we obtain: $d \sin \theta = n\lambda$ - this is known as the \emph{diffraction grating equation}.

Note that the greatest angle through which a beam of light can be diffracted is 90$^\circ$ which puts a constraint on the highest order possible:
\begin{equation*}
n_\tmax = \frac{d\sin\theta_\tmax}{\lambda} < \frac{d \sin 90^\circ}{\lambda} \RA \boxed{n_\tmax < \frac{d}{\lambda}}
\end{equation*}

The value of $\frac{d}{\lambda}$ should be rounded \emph{down} to the nearest whole number to give $n_\tmax$

If white light is passed through diffraction gratings, \emph{dispersion} is observed, this is the cause of the pretty colours seen in a dvd or cd:

\newpage
Some notes on the peculiarities of this effect:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] At zeroth order, diffraction grating equation $d\sin\theta_0 = 0\cdot\lambda$ is satisfied at $\theta_0 = 0$ for any $\lambda$, so we observe a collection of all colours, i.e., a white central maxima.
	
	\item[--] At first order, $d\sin\theta_1 = 1\cdot\lambda$, maxima for long wavelengths appear at greater angles, so the spectrum spreads into a rainbow band, with red light at outer end and violet closer to the centre.
	
	\item[--] At higher orders, the spectrum would be more spread out as the frequency dependence of diffracted angle becomes more pronounced. The spectra of different orders may even overlap to give complicated combinations.
\end{compactitem}

The diffraction grating is an import device in analysis of light - it is widely used in measurement of wavelength of light and in telecommunications.

\example{Light of 632 nm wavelength produces first-order maxima at 16$^\circ$ when passing through a diffraction grating at right angles. How many lines per millimetre are there in the diffraction grating?}

\begin{soln} slit separation: $d = \frac{n\lambda}{\sin\theta} = \frac{1\times632\times10^{-9}}{\sin 16^\circ} \RA d \approx 2.29 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$

number of lines in 1 mm: $N = \frac{1 \text{ mm}}{2.29 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-3}}{2.29 \times 10^{-6}} \RA N \approx 436$ \end{soln}

\example{Green light of 510 nm wavelength is incident normally on a diffraction grating with slit separation of 2.0 $\mu$m. (a) What is the highest order seen? (b) how many maxima are produced? (c) If blue light is used for the same diffraction grating experiment, suggest the effect on the diffraction pattern.}

\begin{soln} to find highest order, we have: $n_\tmax < \frac{d\sin 90^\circ}{\lambda} = \frac{2.0\times10^{-6}}{510\times10^{-9}} \approx 3.9 \RA n_\tmax = 3$

1st, 2nd, 3rd-order on either side and 0th-order at centre, so $ 2\times 3 + 1 = 7$ maxima are formed

blue light has shorter wavelength, so more maxima will be produced with blue light, and separation between each maxima would be closer \end{soln}

\example{Light of wavelength 630 nm produces a second-order maxima at angle of $60^\circ$ when it is directed at a diffraction grating. If visible light of another wavelength can also give a maximum at the same angle, what is this wavelength?}

\begin{soln} using diffraction grating equation: $d \sin\theta = n\lambda$, we find $n\lambda$ is constant for fixed $\theta$

from information given in the question, this constant is $ 2\times630 = 1260 \text{ nm}$

if $n=1$, $\lambda = 1260 \text{ nm}$, which would be infra-red

if $n=3$, $\lambda = 420 \text{ nm}$, which would be visible (violet)

if $n\geq 4$, $\lambda \leq 315 \text{ nm}$, which would be ultraviolet

so the desired wavelength is 420 nm \end{soln}


\subsection{Diffraction}

A wave has the ability to bend around obstacles or pass through narrow gaps

\begin{ilight}
	When a wave passes through a aperture/slit/gap/hole or encounters an obstacle, it spreads out/around the corners, this is known as \keypoint{diffraction}\index{diffraction} of waves.
\end{ilight}

Diffraction is a general property of all waves. Some examples of diffraction are:

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] sound waves can diffract through an open door
	
	so you can hear people in the next room talking, even though you cannot see them
	
	\item[--] light ray can bend when it goes through/around a small hole/small particles
	
	sky appears red at sunset as red light is diffracted most by dust particles in atmosphere
\end{compactitem}

Diffraction is a scale-dependent effect - a wave is diffracted most when its wavelength is close to size of aperture/obstacle. Because a single object is close to an ``infinite gap'', longer wavelengths usually diffracts more around an edge than a wave of shorter wavelength.

If we go beyond the GCSE understanding of diffraction as above we can we can see that the light passing through a single slit forms a diffraction pattern somewhat different from those formed by double slits or diffraction gratings, which we discuss earlier in the chapter on interference.

Note that the central maximum is larger than maxima on either side and that the intensity decreases rapidly on either side. In contrast, a diffraction grating produces evenly spaced lines that dim slowly on either side of the center.

\caption{Analysis of single slit diffraction}
 %\forceversofloat
\end{figure*}

The analysis of single-slit diffraction is illustrated in Figure \ref{singleslitmaths} in which the light arrives at the slit, illuminating it uniformly and is in phase across its width. We then consider light propagating onwards from different parts of the same slit. 

Assuming the screen is very far away compared with the size of the slit, rays heading toward a common destination are nearly parallel. When they travel straight ahead, they remain in phase, and we observe a central maximum. However, when rays travel at an angle $\theta$ relative to the original direction of the beam, each ray travels a different distance to a common location, and they can arrive in or out of phase. The ray from the bottom travels a distance of one wavelength farther than the ray from the top. Thus, a ray from the center travels a distance $\lambda/2$ less than the one at the bottom edge of the slit, arrives out of phase, and interferes destructively. A ray from slightly above the center and one from slightly above the bottom also cancel one another. In fact, each ray from the slit interferes destructively with another ray. In other words, a pair-wise cancellation of all rays results in a dark minimum in intensity at this angle. By symmetry, another minimum occurs at the same angle to the right of the incident direction (toward the bottom of the figure) of the light.

As seen in the figure, the difference in path length for rays from either side of the slit is  $a \sin{\theta}$  and we see that a destructive minimum is obtained when this distance is an integral multiple of the wavelength.

Thus, to obtain destructive interference for a single slit,

$$ a \sin{\theta} = m \lambda$$ 
Where:
m is the order of the minimum.\\
a is the slit width,\\
$\lambda$  is the lightâ€™s wavelength,\\
$\theta$  is the angle relative to the original direction of the light\\

\subsection{Stationary waves}

\subsection{Formation of stationary waves}

Stationary waves are often formed when a travelling wave is \emph{reflected}. Forward-moving wave and backward-moving reflected wave combine to form stationary wave.

\begin{ilight}
	When two waves of same frequency and same speed travel in opposite directions and meet together, they superpose to form stable regions of constructive and destructive interference, this forms a \keypoint{stationary wave}, also known as a \keypoint{standing wave}\index{stationary wave}

from this one can visualise how the pattern of a stationary wave varies with time (see Figure \ref{fig:statwave}. There are points in the wave where destructive interference always occurs, these points are called \keypoint{nodes}, which have zero amplitudes. \index{node}

The points oscillating with the greatest amplitudes are called \keypoint{anti-nodes}. \index{anti-node} Points other than nodes and anti-nodes oscillate with different amplitudes.

\subsection{Stationary wave pattern \& boundary conditions}

Patterns of stationary waves depend heavily on the boundary conditions
The end can be \emph{fixed}, also called a \emph{closed} end, to form a \emph{node} - such as with a wave on a string.

The end can also be \emph{free} to oscillate, known as an \emph{open} end, to form \emph{an anti-node} - such as you might find in a flute.



\subsection*{Stationary wave between two fixed ends}

With both ends fixed, the two ends are both nodes, three patterns with the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies are shown:

		\node at (0,-2) {3rd harmonic};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{minipage}\hfil
\end{figure*}

The longest-wavelength mode is called the \emph{fundamental mode}, it also has lowest frequency. Modes with higher frequencies are usually referred to as \emph{excited modes}, or \emph{harmonics}\footnote{These modes are closely related to the notes played on musical instruments.}
in many texts different modes are labelled as 1st, 2nd, 3rd \emph{harmonics}, etc.

If two ends are separated by a distance of $L$, then wavelengths for different modes are:
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_1 = 2L \qquad \lambda_2 = L \qquad \lambda_3 = \frac{2L}{3} \qquad \cdots \qquad \lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}
\end{equation*}

Making comparison with the fundamental wavelength $\lambda_1$ $\lambda_1$, we have
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{2} \qquad \lambda_3 = \frac{\lambda_1}{3} \qquad \cdots \qquad \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n}
\end{equation*}

Since wave speed remains constant as wave travels through the same medium, the frequency of each mode is inversely proportional to its wavelength, hence,  
\begin{equation*}
f_2 = 2f_1 \qquad f_3 = 3f_1 \qquad \cdots \qquad f_n=n f_1
\end{equation*}

\example{\emph{Melde's experiment} demonstrates a stationary wave formed on a vibrating string using an oscillator set at a particular frequency. Given that the length of the string is 80 cm. (a) What is the wavelength of this wave? (b) If one wants to construct a stationary of longer wavelength, suggest what changes can be made?}

to have larger wavelength, one could do either of the following:
use a string with greater length (while keeping frequency of oscillator unchanged)
reduce the frequency of oscillation (constant wave speed, so $\lambda$ increases)

\titem increase tension in string (wave speed increases \end{soln}\footnote{The speed $v$ of a progressive wave travelling along a string of length $L$ and mass $m$ can be given by the equation: $v = \sqrt{\frac{TL}{m}}$, where $T$ is the tension in the string.} for same frequency, so $\lambda$ increases)




\subsection*{Stationary wave between one fixed end and one open end}

In this case, we have a node at one end and an anti-node at the other end, again we give the three patterns with the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies.

%	\caption{The three lowest frequency modes of wave patterns formed between one fixed end and one open end}
\end{figure*}

\cmt longest-wavelength/lowest-frequency mode is also called the \emph{fundamental mode}

excited modes are called \emph{harmonics} as before

\cmt wavelengths for allowed patterns under the boundary conditions are
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_1 = 4L \qquad \lambda_2 = \frac{4L}{3} \qquad \lambda_3 = \frac{4L}{5} \qquad \cdots \qquad \lambda_n = \frac{4L}{2n-1}

comparing with the fundamental wavelength $\lambda_1$, we find

\lambda_2 = \frac{\lambda_1}{3} \qquad \lambda_3 = \frac{\lambda_1}{5} \qquad \cdots \qquad \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{2n-1}
\end{equation*}

again the wave speed should be the same for all modes, so the allowed frequencies are
\begin{equation*}
f_2 = 3f_1 \qquad f_3 = 5f_1 \qquad \cdots \qquad f_n=(2n-1) f_1

frequency: $f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{340}{0.664} \RA f \approx 512 \text{ Hz}$

\subsection*{Stationary wave between two open ends}

This is left as an exercise for the reader to prove:

You should verify that the allowed wavelengths are: $\lambda = 2L, \, L, \,\frac{2}{3}L, \cdots, \frac{2L}{n}, \cdots$

Frequencies of the fundamental and excited modes go as $f = f_1, \, 2f_1, \, 3f_1, \cdots, nf_1 \cdots$

The required practical version of this is covered in Example \ref{recpracwave}, however there is a version that often appears in exam questions as follows;

	\caption{arrangement of apparatuses for setting up a stationary sound wave}
\end{figure}

\cmt To set up a stationary sound wave, we need two travelling waves in opposite directions, this sound wave can be produced by a \emph{loudspeaker} (coupled to a \emph{signal generator}). The forward-travelling wave is reflected at a \emph{metal plate} and the reflected wave superposes with wave from loudspeaker to give a stationary wave.
The wave intensity at any point can be detected by a \emph{microphone} and observed on an \emph{oscilloscope}. To verify whether stationary wave is formed, we check whether nodes are formed - the positions of the metal plate and the microphone are adjusted carefully and if there exists a location where no signal is detected, this means microphone is at a node and a stationary wave has been formed between loudspeaker and reflector.
To then find wavelength of sound wave, we slowly move microphone to the next node, the wavelength of sound wave: $\lambda = 2\times \text{distance between neighbouring nodes}$

To find frequency of sound wave, we move microphone to anywhere that is not a node, from time base of the oscilloscope, we can work out period $T$ of the wave. Frequency is then given by the formula: $f=\frac{1}{T}$.

Finally,  speed of the sound wave\footnote{We should bear in mind that stationary waves do not propagate through space, so rigorously speaking, it is incorrect to say the speed of a stationary way. The wave speed calculated in this way refers to the speed of either of the two travelling waves that give rise to the stationary wave through superposition.} can be calculated: $v=\lambda f$




\subsection{Stationary waves \& progressive waves}

There are quite a few differences between a stationary wave and a progressive wave:

A progressive wave can transfer energy from one place to another but for stationary waves, vibrational energy is not transferred due to existence of nodes. 

In a stationary wave, all part have the same amplitude. Different points in general have different amplitudes over a stationary wave. Nodes have zero amplitude, anti-nodes have greatest amplitudes. Other points have various amplitudes depending on their positions.

In a progressive wave the displacements of each point at a particular moment can be all different, but the largest displacements they can reach are the same (if no loss of energy). This means that the phase difference between any two points in a progressive wave can take any value and different points reach their peaks at different times for a progressive wave so $\Delta \phi$ can be anything from 0 to $2\pi$ (or anything from 0 to $360^\circ$).

Phase difference between any two points in a stationary wave however, is either 0 or $\pi$ (or $180^\circ$). For points between adjacent nodes, they all reach their highest at same time despite differences in amplitudes, these points are all in phase, so $\Delta \phi=0$.
For points separated by one node, they are anti-phase, because when one is at its peak, the other is at its trough, so $\Delta \phi = \pi$ (or $180^\circ$)
