\chapter{Kinematics}

Kinematics is the study of motion. We will introduce three kinematic quantities, displacement, velocity and acceleration, and see how these terms are used to describe an object's motion.

\section{Kinematic quantities}

\subsection{Displacement \& Distance}

In everyday language, we talk about the \keypoint{distance} travelled by an object, which usually refers to the length travelled by an object without considering in which direction it moves, to fully describe position of an object however, we also need specify where it is heading.

\begin{ilight}
	\centering \keypoint{displacement} is defined as the distance moved by an object in a specific direction\index{displacement}
\end{ilight}

 Displacement is the \emph{straight-line} distance pointing from starting point towards end point -even if actual path taken is curved, ie it is a vector quantity, while distance is a scalar. Displacement is always the straight-line distance. Displacement and distance are measured in metres, or any reasonable length units.


 \begin{figure*}[!ht]

	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
%	\draw[step=0.5] (0,0) grid (5,5);
	 \draw[thick, dashed,->] (0,0) node[below]{start} [out=150, in=140] to (0.5,2) [out=-40, in=210] to (2.5,4) [out=30, in=185] to (4,3) [out=-5, in=160] to (5.5,4) [out=-20, in=55] to (5,2) node[right]{end};

	 \node[note] at (0.6,2.6) {distance};
	 \node[note] at (3.2,0.5) {displacement};
	 \draw (5.7,3) --++ (1,0.6) node[right] {actual path taken};

	\end{tikzpicture}
	
	\caption{difference between displacement and distance}
\end{figure*}


\example{An athlete is running around a circular track of radius 60 m. When he completes one lap, what is the distance moved out? What about his displacement?}

\begin{soln}
    
Distance moved is the perimeter of the circle: $s = 2\pi r = 2\pi\times 60 \approx 380 \text{ m}$

athlete returns to same starting point after one lap, so displacement is zero
\end{soln}

	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.1]
	\draw[thick,->] (0,0) -- (0,3) node[midway, left]{30 km};
	\draw[thick,->] (0,3) -- (4,3) node[midway, above]{40 km};
	\draw[thick,blue,->] (0,0) -- (4,3) node[midway, below, rotate=36.89]{50 km};
	\draw (0,0.5) arc(90:36.89:0.5);
	\node at (63:0.8) {$\theta$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{figure}

\example{A ship travels 30 km north, takes a right, and then travels 40 km east to reach its destination. Compare the distance and the displacement travelled.}

\begin{soln}
Summing of all lengths gives distance: $30+40 = 70 \text{ km}$

The displacement vector is shown on the diagram.

$\text{The magnitude of displacement} = \sqrt{30^2 + 40^2} = 50 \text{ km}$

at an angle of $\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{40}{30} \approx 53^\circ$ east of north
\end{soln} 



\subsection{Velocity \& speed}

The displacement of a moving object may change with respect to time, the rate of this change in displacement gives us the velocity with which it's moving.

\begin{ilight}
	The change in displacement per unit time is called the \keypoint{velocity} of the object velocity: \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{v = {\Delta s}/{\Delta t}}\end{empheq}
\end{ilight}

Velocity is a vector quantity which follows from the fact that displacement is a vector quantity. The SI unit of measurement for velocity: $[v]= \mps$ 

In the case of vector quantities in one dimension, \emph{linear} motion, we always assign a direction and indicate this with positive and negative signs. A negative velocity implies motion in the opposite direction to positive.

Defining equation $v=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$ gives the \emph{average} value for velocity or speed over an interval $\Delta t$ more precisely: \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{\text{average velocity} = \frac{\text{total displacement}}{\text{time taken}}}\end{empheq} and... \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{\text{average speed} = \frac{\text{total distance}}{\text{time taken}}}\end{empheq}

This should be distinguished from the notion of \emph{instantaneous velocity}instantaneous velocity; defined as the rate of change in displacement at a particular instant.

If we take a very short interval $\Delta t$, as $\Delta t \to 0$, average velocity tends to instantaneous velocity, this is expressed in a compact differential form: $v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} \ra$ \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{v=\frac{\dd s}{\dd t}} \end{empheq}


\newpage

It is also common to use \keypoint{speed} to describe how fast an object moves, the speed is defined as the change of the distance travelled per unit time. Velocity can be thought as speed in a particular direction.

\example{A cyclist travels a distance of 3.0 km in 20 minutes. She rests for 15 minutes. She then covers a further distance of 5.1 km in a time of 40 minutes. Calculate the average speed of the cyclist in m s$^{-1}$: (a) during the first 20 minutes of the journey, (b) for the whole journey.}

\begin{soln} For the first 20 minutes: $ v = \frac{3.0\times10^3}{20 \times 60} = 2.5 \mps$

\eqyskip For whole journey: $v = \frac{(3.0+0+5.1)\times10^3}{(20+15+40)\times60} = 1.8 \mps $ 
\end{soln}

\example{A man walks along a straight road for a distance of 800 m in 5.0 minutes. He then turns around, and walks along the same road for a distance of 280 m in 3.0 minutes. What is the average speed and the average velocity of this man during the 8.0 minutes?}

\begin{soln} $\text{Total distance travelled} = 800 + 280 = 1080 \text{m}$, so average speed: $v = \frac{1080}{8.0\times60} = 2.25 \mps$

\eqyskip  $\text{change of displacement} = 800 + (-280) = 520 \text{m}$, so average velocity: $v = \frac{520}{8.0\times60} \approx 1.08 \mps$ \end{soln}

\example{A maglev train travels at an average speed of $60\mps$ from the city centre to the airport, and at $40\mps$ on its return journey over the same distance. What is the average speed of the round-trip? What about the average velocity?}

\begin{soln} Suppose the distance between airport and city centre is $S$.

Average speed: $v = \frac{2S}{t_1 + t_2} = \frac{2S}{\frac{S}{60} + \frac{S}{40}} = 48 \mps$

For a round-trip, train returns to same staring position so change in displacement is zero. Average velocity is therefore \emph{Zero} \end{soln} 


\subsection{Acceleration}

The velocity of a moving object may change, i.e., objects can speed up, slow down \textbf{or make turns}

\begin{ilight}
	\centering Change in velocity per unit time is defined as the \keypoint{acceleration}\index{acceleration}: \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}}\end{empheq}
\end{ilight}

\titem{unit of measurement for acceleration: $[a]= \mpss$}

Acceleration\footnote{Joe often writes this as "$Accl^{n}$" on the board. Useful shorthand that!} is a vector quantity, it has both magnitude and direction. Because of vector nature of velocity, change in velocity must also have direction. When we're considering \emph{linear} motion, we usually pick direction of initial velocity as positive direction, often left to right.

\titem $a>0$ would imply acceleration in the normal sense, i.e., motion with an increasing speed.

\titem $a<0$ would imply deceleration, i.e., motion with a decreasing speed.

When velocity changes, it could be change in magnitude or/and change in direction\footnote{Acceleration of an object can be considered as the combination of two components. One component is known as the \emph{normal} acceleration or the \emph{centripetal} acceleration, which is at right angle to the velocity and is responsible for the change in direction of motion. The other component is called the \emph{tangential} acceleration, which is parallel to the direction of motion and causes change in magnitude of object's velocity. You will learn more about these in further mechanics.} for example, for an object moving along a curved path, its velocity is constantly changing direction, so it must have a non-zero acceleration. An acceleration of Zero on the other hand would imply no change in speed and no change in direction of motion.

The defining equation, which gives average acceleration over time interval $\Delta t$ is: $$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$ 

We can likewise introduce \emph{instantaneous acceleration} as the rate of change in velocity. Taking the limit where the time interval $\Delta t \to 0$. we have: $a = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \ra$ \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{a=\frac{\dd v}{\dd t}} \end{empheq}

\example{A ball hits a barrier at right angles with a speed of $15 \mps$. It makes contact with the barrier for 30 ms and then rebounds with a speed of $12 \mps$. What is the average acceleration during the time of contact?}

\begin{soln} 
note that direction of velocity changed during rebound, so $\Delta v = 15 - (-12) = 27 \mps$

average acceleration: $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{27}{30 \times 10^{-3}} = 900 \mpss$ \end{soln}



\subsection{Motion graphs}

How one quantity changes with another quantity can be visually shown on a \emph{graph}, changes in displacement, velocity or acceleration over time can be shown on \emph{motion graphs}\index{motion graphs}. As we will see, $s$-$t$ graph, $v$-$t$ graph and $a$-$t$ graphs are closely interrelated to one another.

\subsection{Displacement-time graphs}

A displacement-time graph shows an object's position at any given time:

{
	\centering
	
	$ v = \frac{11.6 - 0}{4.0-0.75} \approx 3.6 \mps $
	
}
\end{soln}

\subsection{Velocity-time graphs}

A velocity-time graph shows the velocity of a moving object at any instant, since the rate of change of velocity gives the acceleration;

\begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}\text{acceleration} = \text{gradient of $v$-$t$ graph}\end{empheq}


\noindent A $v$-$t$ graph also gives information about the change in displacement, that is:
\begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{\text{change in displacement} = \text{area under $v$-$t$ graph}}\end{empheq}


The reasoning here is that in very short interval $\Delta t_i$, change in velocity is small so $v(t_i)\approx\text{constant}$ during $\Delta t_i$. Following the logic, the displacement changed by $\Delta s_i \approx v(t_i) \Delta t_i$, which corresponds to area of a thin rectangle. The sum of all these small $\Delta s_i$'s gives total change in displacement over a period of time. If we now consider the limit where each of the time interval $\Delta t_i \to 0$ then the total area of these rectangles approximates area bounded by the $v$-$t$ curve and time axis.
\footnote{Mathematically, integration is the inverse operation of taking derivatives. By definition $v=\frac{\dd s}{\dd t}$, then it follows naturally that $\Delta s = \int v\dd t$. While the derivative of a given function gives the gradient of tangent at each point on its graph, integrating a function gives the signed area bounded by the graph. The reader may find the formal treatment of this relationship in any calculus textbook.}

\subsection{Acceleration-time graphs}

In the same way as above, one can similarly plot an acceleration-time graph to give the changes in acceleration, ie. $a$-$t$ graphs can give information about changes in velocity. Similar discussions lead to the following conclusion:\footnote{Using area under $a$-$t$ graph to find changes in velocity is not required in the AS-Level physics syllabus. I am putting this in the notes mainly for the completeness of the discussions on motion graphs.}
\begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}\text{change in velocity} = \text{area under $a$-$t$ graph}

\subsection{Linear motion with constant velocity}

let's look at the simplest kind of motion, an object moving at constant speed in a straight line: $\, v=\text{constant}$.

In this case the equations of motion are the straightforward ones met at GCSE: $$\, \tcbhighmath{a=0}$$ 
and $$ \tcbhighmath{s=vt}$$ \footnote[][-1cm]{It is implicitly assumed that the motion starts from the origin with respect to which displacement is defined. More generically, we should write: $s = s_0 + vt$, where $s_0$ is the initial displacement.}
Where S, represents displacement, V, the velocity and t, the time. You have met these a lot, we'll not say much more about them...

\subsection{Linear motion with constant acceleration}

More complex motion will involve a change in velocity and we limit ourselves at A-level to situations where this change in velocity is constant. ie we have linear motion with constant acceleration $a=\text{constant}$. When we do this we see that our motion graphs look as below:

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Equations of motion}

In order to be able to solve problems relating to motion we need more powerful tools than we have met at GCSE. By combining the equation for acceleration with the definitive equation for velocity, we can come up with a set of motion equations commonly referred to as "the SUVAT equations". 

During a time interval $t$, suppose velocity changes from initial value $u$ to final value $v$. From the defining equation of acceleration $a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v-u}{t}$, we get\footnote{Proof with calculus: $\dd v = a \dd t \ra \Delta v = \int_{u}^{v} \dd v = \int_{0}^{t} a\dd t \ra v-u=at \ra v=u+at$}:

\begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation}\label{eqn:const_a_eq1}{v=u+at}
\end{empheq}

This is the first equation in our series. 

To find total displacement travelled, we compute the area under the $v$-$t$ graph
\begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation}\label{eqn:const_a_eq2}{s=\frac{1}{2}(u+v)t}
\end{empheq}
for which we can interpret $\bar{v}=\frac{1}{2}(u+v)$ as the average velocity during that time

plug \eqref{eqn:const_a_eq1} into \eqref{eqn:const_a_eq2}, we find an expression for the displacement travelled in terms of $u$ and $a$:\footnote{Proof with calculus: $\dd s = v \dd t \ra \Delta s = \int_0^s \dd s = \int_0^t v\dd t \ra s = \int_0^t (u+at)\dd t = \big(ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2\big)\bigg|_0^t \ra s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$}
\footnote{Equation \eqref{eqn:const_a_eq3} assumes a zero initial displacement at $t=0$. If there is a non-zero initial displacement, one should write $s = s_0 + ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$. Similar discussion applies to equation \eqref{eqn:const_a_eq2}.}

\begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation}\label{eqn:const_a_eq3}{s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2}
\end{empheq}

This shows the displacement $s$ is a quadratic function in time $t$, consistent with the parabolic shape of the $s$-$t$ graph shown. We can also eliminate the time variable $t$ to derive one last equation from \eqref{eqn:const_a_eq1} we have $t=\frac{v-u}{a}$, substitute this into \eqref{eqn:const_a_eq2}, we find
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:const_a_eq4}
	s=\frac{1}{2}(u+v)\times\frac{v-u}{a} \RA \end{equation}
 \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{2as = v^2 - u^2}
\end{empheq}

\example{A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 5.0 m s$^{-2}$ for 6.0 s.\\ (a) How fast is the car travelling at $t=8.0$ s? \\(b) What is the distance travelled by the car in this time?}
\begin{soln}
\begin{equation*}
v=u+at \RA v = 0 + 5.0\times 6.0 = 30 \mps
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2 \RA s= 0+\frac{1}{2}\times5.0\times6.0^2 = 90 \text{ m} 
\end{equation*}
\end{soln}

\example{A car is travelling at 30\mps. A hazard appears in front of the car, and the driver takes immediate action to stop the car. When brakes are applied, deceleration of the car is 5.0\mpss. What is the braking distance?}
\begin{soln}
\begin{equation*}
2as=v^2-u^2 \RA s = \frac{v^2-u^2}{2a} = \frac{0^2 - 30^2}{2\times(-5.0)} = 90 \text{ m} 
\end{equation*}
\end{soln}

\example{At the instant the traffic light turns green, a motorcycle waiting at the stop line starts with a constant acceleration of $2.0 \mpss$. At the same instant, a truck at a constant speed of $16 \mps$ overtakes and passes the motorcycle. How far beyond the stop line will the motorcycle overtake the truck?}

\begin{soln} Lets suppose overtake occurs at time $t$ after motorcycle starts to accelerate, so the distance travelled by motorcycle: $$s_m = u_mt + \frac{1}{2}at^2  \RA s_m = 0 + \frac{1}{2}\times 2.0 \times t^2$$

In the same time the distance travelled by truck: $$s_t = v_t t \RA s_t = 16t$$

The overtake when: $$s_m = s_t \RA \frac{1}{2}\times 2.0 \times t^2 = 16 t \RA t=16 \text{ s}$$

Substitute $t$ into either $s_m$ or $s_t$, one finds distance travelled: $s = 256 \text{ m}$ 
\end{soln}




\subsection{Free fall}\label{ch_freefall}

A typical example of uniformly accelerated motion is the free fall\index{free fall} everything has the tendency to fall towards ground due to earth's gravity, in this section, we assume that effects of air resistance are negligible, acceleration of free fall is then constant $a=g$. The value of $g$ does not depend on mass of the falling object\footnote{The reason for this constant acceleration of free fall will be elaborated in $\S$\ref{ch_weight}.} Near surface of earth, the value of the acceleration due to gravity is: $g\approx9.81\mpss$, of course value of $g$ could be different on a different planet\footnote[][]{Note that Maths will make you use 9.8\mpss}

For a freely-falling object released from rest, its velocity increases with time as
\begin{equation*}
	v=u+at = 0 + gt \RA v = gt
\end{equation*}

and the distance it has fallen from the point of release is:
\begin{equation*}
s=ut+\frac{1}{2} at^2 = 0\cdot t + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \RA s=\frac{1}{2}gt^2
\end{equation*}

\example{An object is released from rest from a height of $h=24$ m and falls freely under gravity. Air resistance is negligible.\\ (a) How long does it take to hit the ground? \\(b) What is its speed when hitting the ground?}
\begin{soln}
\begin{equation*}
h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \RA t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2\times24}{9.81}} \approx 2.21 \text{ s}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
v = gt = 9.81 \times 2.21 \RA v \approx 21.7 \mps
\end{equation*}

to find final velocity, one can also use $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$:
\begin{equation*}
v^2 = \cancelto{0}{u^2} + 2gh = 2\times9.81\times24 \RA v \approx 21.7 \mps 
\end{equation*}
\end{soln}

\example{A photograph is taken for a small particle falling from rest. The photograph is taken at 0.400 s after the object is released. Since the particle is still moving when the photograph is being taken, the image is blurred. It is found the blurred part corresponds to a length of 20.8 cm moved out by the particle, what is time of exposure for the photograph?}

\begin{soln} from $t=0$ to right before photo is taken: 
{	\centering
	
	$s_1 = \frac{1}{2}gt_1^2 = \frac{1}{2}\times9.81\times0.400^2 \approx 0.785 \text{ m}$
	
}

from $t=0$ to right after photo has been taken: 

{
	\centering
	
	$s_2 = s_1 + \Delta s = \frac{1}{2}gt^2_2 \RA t_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2(s_1+\Delta s)}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2\times(0.785+0.208)}{9.81}} \approx 0.450 \text{ s}$
	
}

time of exposure: $\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 = 0.450 - 0.400 \approx 0.050 \text{ s}$ 
\end{soln}


\subsection{Upward projection}

Like a freely-falling object, an object thrown upwards experiences the same constant downward acceleration $a=g\approx9.81\mpss$, as long as drag forces can be ignored. Remember that we pretend that we live in a "Perfect Physics World"\texttrademark for most of the A-level course. No air resistance, no friction, no inconvenient complexities. \begin{marginfigure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{sphericalcow.png}
        \caption{Milk production at a dairy farm was at an all-time low, so the farmer decided to call on the local university for help. A team of the institutions' top scientists was assembled to work on the problem. The team of scientists visited the farm and took extensive data carefully examining every step of the production process. The leader of the team, a theoretical physicist, offered to write the report. A week later the physicist returned to the farm, saying to the farmer, "I have found a solution for your problem, but it only works for spherical cows in vacuum."}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{marginfigure}

Note that initial velocity $u$ is upwards, but acceleration $a$ is downwards
so we will have different signs for $u$ and $a$ in the equations, conventionally, positive direction is taken as same direction as initial velocity. In our case, positive direction is upwards, the acceleration is then negative: $a=-g$ so the velocity-time relation and displacement-time relation are:
\begin{equation*}
v = u - gt \quad \quad s = ut - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
\end{equation*}

\caption{$v$-$t$ graph and $s$-$t$ graph for upward projectile motion}
\end{figure*}

The sign of $v$ now tells direction of motion, $v>0$ means object is moving upwards, $v<0$ means it has reversed direction and starts falling, in particular, an object attains greatest height when $v=0$.

The sign of $s$ gives whether object is at a higher or lower position with respect to point of release.

\titem $s>0$ means the object is above the position from which it is projected

\titem $s<0$ means it is now below the point of release

\example{A ball is projected vertically upwards at $12 \mps$. Air resistance is negligible. (a) Find the time taken for the ball to reach the highest position. (b) Find the greatest height.}
	
\begin{soln} maximum height is reached when $v=0$, so

	\centering
	
	$v = u-gt = 0 \RA t= \frac{u}{g} = \frac{12}{9.81} \approx 1.22 \text{ s}$
	
	$H_\tmax = ut-\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = 12\times1.22 - \frac{1}{2}\times9.81\times1.22^2 \approx 7.34 \text{ m}$
	


It is also possible to use $v^2 - u^2 = 2as$ to find $H_\tmax$:
\begin{equation*}
0^2 - u^2 = 2(-g)H_\tmax \RA H_\tmax = \frac{u^2}{2g} = \frac{12^2}{2\times9.81} \approx 7.34 \text{ m} 
\end{equation*}
\end{soln}

\example{A stone is thrown vertically upwards with an initial velocity of $14.0\mps$	from the edge of a cliff that is 35 m from the sea below.  \\(a) Find the speed at which it hits the sea. \\(b) Find the time taken for the stone to hit the sea.}
\footnote{Note that we have substituted  $a=-g$ since acceleration of free fall always points downwards, and $s=-35\text{ m}$ since sea is below point of release. Also final velocity when hitting water is downwards, which should take a negative sign, so we discarded the positive solution for $v$.}
\begin{soln}
 Take positive direction to point upwards, we use $v^2 - u^2 = 2as$ to find $v^2 = 14.0^2 + 2\times(-9.81)\times(-35) \approx 883 \text{ m}^2 \text{ s}^{-2} \RA v\approx -29.7\mps$.
 To find time, we can use $v = u-gt$, hence: $ t = \frac{v-u}{-g} = \frac{-29.7-14.0}{-9.81} \approx 4.46 \text{ s} $.

One can also attempt $s = ut - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$, this leads to the equation: $-35 = 14.0t - \frac{1}{2}\times9.81t^2$.

This quadratic equation in $t$ gives two roots: $t_1 \approx 4.46 \text{ s}$, and $t_2 \approx -1.60 \text{ s}$.

Note that a negative root should be discarded since it means stones hits the sea before it is thrown so time taken for stone to hit the sea is $t \approx 4.46\text{ s}$ \end{soln}

\subsection{Motion in two dimensions -- projectile motion}\label{ch:projectile}

For projectile motion, we assume no air resistance and no other forces
gravity causes a constant acceleration of free fall that acts vertically downwards. The curved path of a projectile is the combination of its \emph{horizontal} and \emph{vertical} motion.

\titem horizontally: no acceleration, so horizontal component of velocity $v_x = \text{constant}$

\titem vertically: constant acceleration, vertical component of velocity $v_y$ varies over time

As a consequence, a projectile would follows a \emph{parabolic} path as it travels\footnote{{You may be able to prove this statement in Question \ref{Q-projectile-eqn}.}{You may try to prove this statement with a bit algebra.}}

Let's consider a projectile launched at initial velocity $u$ at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal:

\begin{figure*}[htp]

	}
	\draw (0.5,0) arc(0:60:0.5);
	\node at (30:0.7) {$\theta$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{components of the velocity of a projectile at different points along its path}
\end{figure*}

Horizontally, projectile maintains a constant velocity, so:
\begin{equation*}
v_x = u_x \qquad x=u_x t
\end{equation*}

Where $u_x = u\cos\theta$ is horizontal component of initial velocity vertically, if upward direction is taken to be positive, then acceleration $a=-g$, so
\begin{equation*}
v_y = u_y + at = u_y - gt  \qquad y = u_y t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 = u_y t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
\end{equation*}

where $u_y = u\sin\theta$ is vertical component of initial velocity - components can be combined to give resultant velocity or resultant displacement:
\begin{equation*}
 v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} \qquad s = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\end{equation*}


\subsection*{Maximum height reached by an projectile}

When a projectile reaches the highest position, its instantaneous vertical velocity becomes zero, we can then find the time it takes to attain this maximum height.
\begin{equation*}
	v_y = u\sin\theta - gt = 0 \RA t = \frac{u\sin\theta}{g}
\end{equation*}
	
To find $H_\tmax$, one can use either equation \eqref{eqn:const_a_eq2} or \eqref{eqn:const_a_eq3} 
	\begin{equation*}
	H_\tmax = \frac{1}{2}(u_y+v_y) t = \frac{1}{2}u_y t = \frac{1}{2} \times u \sin\theta \times \frac{u\sin\theta}{g} = \frac{u^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g}
	\end{equation*}
	\begin{equation*}
	H_\tmax = u_y t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 = u \sin\theta \times \frac{u\sin\theta}{g} - \frac{g}{2} \times \left(\frac{u\sin\theta}{g}\right)^2 = \frac{u^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g}
	\end{equation*}

For any given initial speed $u$, the greater the angle of projection, the higher the object will reach. In the extremal case where $\theta = 90 ^\circ$, it simply becomes an upwardly projected motion.

\subsection*{Airborne time and horizontal range of an projectile}

A ball projected from the ground will first rise in height but it will eventually fall to the ground due to the gravitational pull after a period of time $T$. When it lands, its vertical displacement is zero, so:
	\begin{equation*}
	Y = u_y T - \frac{1}{2}gT^2 = u \sin \theta T - \frac{1}{2}gT^2 = 0 \RA T = \frac{2u\sin\theta}{g}
	\end{equation*}
	
The horizontal range is given by:
	\begin{equation*}
	X = u_x T = u\cos\theta \times \frac{2u\sin\theta}{g} = \frac{2u^2\sin\theta\cos\theta}{g} \RA X = \frac{u^2\sin2\theta}{g}
	\end{equation*}
	
Where in the last step the trigonometric identity $\sin2\alpha = 2\sin\alpha\cos\alpha$ has been used.

For a given initial speed $u$, a projectile launched at a greater angle will stay in the air for longer time, the greatest airborne time is obtained if object is projected straight up, i.e.,  $\theta =90^\circ$. For a given initial speed, horizontal range of projectile depends on angle $\theta$ of projection, so to obtain the greatest horizontal range, two things are required:

\titem sufficiently large horizontal velocity $v_x$

\titem sufficiently long time $T$ staying in the air

however, a larger $v_x$ requires a smaller $\theta$, which means a shorter airborne time $T$, therefore, there is a compromise between the two. The optimal angle should be neither be too large nor too small, and can be shown to be $45^\circ$ \footnote{You could prove this algebraicly if you were so inclined}

\begin{soln} At the highest point: $v_y = u_y - gt = 0 \RA t = \frac{u\sin\theta}{g} = \frac{15\times\sin40^\circ}{9.81} \approx 0.983 \text{ s}$

Vertical displacement: $y = u_y t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 = 15\sin40^\circ \times 0.983 - \frac{1}{2}\times 9.81 \times 0.983^2 \approx 4.74 \text{ m}$

Horizontal displacement: $x = u_x t = 15\cos40^\circ \times 0.983 \approx 11.3 \text{ m}$

Resultant displacement: $|OP| = \sqrt{x^2 +y^2} = \sqrt{11.3^2 + 4.74^2} \approx 12.2 \text{ m}$

\example{A small object is horizontally projected at 7.20 ms$^{-1}$ from a surface at a height of $h=1.2 \text{ m}$ above the ground. Assume there is no air resistance. (a) What is the time taken for the object to hit the ground? (b) What is the horizontal range? (c) Find the velocity at which the object hits the ground.}

\begin{soln}
    
Vertically, take downward as positive: $h = \cancelto{0}{u_y t} + \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \ra t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{2\times1.2}{9.81}} \approx 0.495 \text{ s} $

Horizontal range: $x = u_x t = 7.20 \times 0.495 \approx 3.56 \text{ m}$

Final vertical velocity: $v_y = \cancelto{0}{u_y} + gt = 9.81 \times 0.495 \approx 4.85 \mps$

Magnitude of resultant velocity: $v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \sqrt{7.20^2 + 4.85^2} \approx 8.68 \mps$

Angle to which resultant velocity makes with horizontal: $\phi = \tan^{-1}\frac{v_y}{v_x} = \tan^{-1}\frac{4.85}{7.20} \approx 34^\circ$
