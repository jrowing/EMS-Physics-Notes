%There is no specific office hour. You can try to find me at my office 9am - 5pm, Monday to Friday. If you have questions about the course, I also recommend you to catch me right after any of my lectures.



\subsection*{About the Lecture Notes}

This is a set of very concise lecture notes written for Eduqas A-level Physics

Throughout the notes, key concepts are marked red, key definitions and important formulas are boxed. Stuff beyond the syllabus, usually shows up in the footnotes and are labelled with a star sign.

Also very importantly, I am certain that there are tons of typos in the notes. If you spot any errors, please let me know.
