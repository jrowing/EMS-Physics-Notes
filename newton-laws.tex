\chapter{Force \& Motion}

\section{Force \& motion: an introduction}

In physics, a force appears when two bodies interact with one another - you will encounter various types of forces in this course, some of which are:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] \emph{weight}: the gravitational attraction acting on any object exerted by the earth
	
	\item[--] \emph{tension}: a force in a string, a rope, a chain, etc. when it is being pulled
	
	\item[--] \emph{normal contact}: when a body's surface is compressed, there reacts a normal contact force\footnote{Examples of normal contact force are support force that stops a desk from sinking into the ground, the impact on a football when you kick it, etc.}
	
	\item[--] \emph{friction}: a force that resists relative motion when two surfaces tend to slide over one another
	
	\item[--] \emph{resistance}: also called drag force, this is experienced when a body travels through a medium

	
	\item[--] \emph{upthrust}: an upward force acting on an object immersed in a fluid
	
	\item[--] \emph{electric force}: an attractive or repulsive interaction between electrically charged objects
	\item[--] \emph{magnetic force}: an attractive or repulsive interaction between magnets or electric currents
\end{compactitem}

Detailed features of these forces follow later in the notes.\\

A force can produce various effects to the object, the effect could be:

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] an increase/decrease in speed
	
	\item[--] a change in the direction of motion
	
	\item[--] causing the object to rotate
	
	\item[--] a change in shape of the object
\end{compactitem}

In the next few chapters, we will be looking into each of these aspects. When more than one force act on a body, it is useful to find their \emph{resultant}, or the \emph{net force}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{resultant force}, or \keypoint{net force}, is a single force that has the same effect as all forces acting on an object combined. The emph{vector sum} of all of the individual forces gives the resultant force.
\end{ilight}

In this chapter, we will study the dynamics of \emph{point masses} - a \keypoint{point mass} is an idealization that the object has a mass but does not take up any space, furthermore an object treated as a point mass has a position specified with a geometric point in space. This is, of course, another simplification when size, shape, rotation, or structure of object are not important (Spherical cows..).\begin{marginfigure}

\subsection{Newton's laws of motion}\index{Newton's laws of motion}

Newton's laws of motion\footnote{These three laws were first addressed by \emph{Isaac Newton} in his famous work \emph{Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy}, or simply the \emph{Principia}. The three-volume work was first published in 1687, and was soon recognised as one of the most important works in the history of science. Apart the from the three laws that laid the foundations for classical mechanics, the \emph{Principia} also stated \emph{the law of gravitation}, and accounted for planetary orbits and tides and other phenomena.} are three laws that form the basis of classical mechanics, they describe the relationships between motion of an object and forces acting on it.

\subsection{Newton's first law}

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{Newton's first law} states that an object continues in its state of rest or uniform motion at constant velocity if there is no resultant force acting
\end{ilight}


Any object `dislikes' any change to its state of motion, uniform motion tends to persist forever, this tendency to resist changes in motion is called the \keypoint{inertia}, in some textbooks, Newton's first law is also called \emph{the law of inertia}. If there is no change in state of motion, the object is said to be in \keypoint{equilibrium}\index{equilibrium}.

\subsection{Newton's Second law}

If resultant force is non-zero, velocity of the object will change, i.e., force produces acceleration.

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{Newton's second law} states that the acceleration is proportional to the resultant force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. Symbolically, we write $a \propto \frac{\fnet}{m}$
\end{ilight}

With consistent units of measure, this proportionality can be written as an exact equation:
\begin{equation*}
a=\frac{\fnet}{m} \quad \text{or} \end{equation*}\begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation} \quad {\fnet=ma}
\end{empheq}

\titem The SI unit of measurement for force $F$ is \keypoint{newton} (N)

A force of one newton acting a body of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 $\mpss$, acceleration produced is always in same direction of the net force. For the same force, an object of greater mass has a smaller acceleration, hence mass is a measure of the \emph{inertia} of this object in response to a net force\index{inertia}.

The way that the mass of an object is defined from the point of view of Newton's laws can be stated as\footnote{The concept of mass can be defined in many different ways. You might be familiar with the definition for mass as the amount of matter an object possesses. I personally think this definition is a bit vague and does not tell you anything new. Thinking of mass as a measure of inertia surely brings more insights. Mass also tells the strength at which an object interacts with other bodies through the gravitational attraction. As you will see later, from the view of Albert Einstein, it is also possible to think of mass as a form of energy.}:

\begin{ilight}
	\centering \keypoint{Mass} is an intrinsic property of a body to resist any change in its state of motion.
\end{ilight}

\example{A box of 6.0 kg is being pushed along a horizontal surface with a force of 30 N. The resistive force acting is 21 N. What is the acceleration of the box?}

\begin{soln}
\begin{equation*}
	\fnet = F - f = ma \RA a = \frac{F-f}{m} = \frac{30-21}{6.0} = 1.5 \mpss 
\end{equation*}
\end{soln}

\example{A car of mass 800 kg is travelling at a speed of $20 \mps$. The driver then operates the brake pedal so a braking force of 2000 N gradually brings the car to stop. (a) What is the deceleration for the car? (b) What is the stopping distance?}


\begin{soln} Using Newton's second law and noticing braking force acts opposite to direction of motion:

{
	\centering
	
	$\fnet = ma \RA -2000 = 800 \times a \RA a = -2.5 \mpss$
	
	$2as = v^2 - u^2 \RA s = \frac{v^2-u^2}{2a} = \frac{0^2 - 20^2}{2\times(-2.5)} = 80\text{ m}$
	
}
\end{soln}

\example{A massive ball is suspended on a string. A second string is attached to the bottom of the ball. If one pulls the bottom string with a gradually increasing force, does the top string or the bottom string break first? What if the bottom string is jerked, which string breaks?}	
	
\begin{soln}
When tension gradually increases, system is always in equilibrium, the tensions in strings must have $T_\text{top} = T_\text{bottom} + mg$. The top string suffers a greater force, so it breaks first, however, when bottom string is jerked, the ball tends to remain at rest due to its large mass, preventing sudden change to the tension in top string so in this case bottom string is more likely to snap.
\end{soln}

\example{Leviation of a slinky - When the top end of the slinky is dropped, the information of the tension change must propagate to the bottom end before both sides begin to fall; the top of an extended slinky will drop while the bottom initially remains in its original position, compressing the spring.}

\subsection{Newton's third law}

Every force is part of a pair of interactions between one body and another, when one body exerts a force on another, the second body also exerts a reaction on the first.

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{Newton's third law}, also called the \keypoint{action-reaction principle}, states that action and reaction are always equal in magnitude, opposite in directions and of the same type.
\end{ilight}

\example{Suggest the action and reaction force in the following cases: (a) A person stands on a bathroom scale. (b) A helicopter hovers in air. (c) The earth orbits around the sun.}

\begin{soln}(a) The person exerts downward force on scale, scale exerts an upward reaction on the person.

(b) The rotors of helicopter push air downwards, air exerts an upward force on helicopter.

(c) The Sun pulls the earth through gravitational attraction, the Earth also attracts the sun in return. \end{soln}


\subsection{Force analysis \& free-body diagrams}

When doing mechanics problems, it is necessary to find all forces applied upon an object, to visualise all these forces, it is helpful to draw a \keypoint{free-body diagram} (FBD)\index{free-body diagram}. A FBD shows a simplified version of the body with arrows indicating forces applied, it is recommended to follow the routine stated below when solving a mechanics problem:

\begin{compactitem}
	\item[(1)] draw a FBD for the object in the problem
	
	\item[(2)] resolve and find the resultant force with aid of the FBD
	
	\item[(3)] apply Newton's laws to write down the equation of motion for the object
	
	\item[(4)] solve the equation(s) to find acceleration
	
	\item[(5)] use kinematic relations to deduce information about motion of the object
\end{compactitem}

\section{Types of forces}

\subsection{Weight}\label{ch_weight}

All objects exert attractive forces of gravity upon each other.\footnote{You will learn more about gravitational forces in Year 13.} The \keypoint{weight} of a body is due to the gravitational pull from our planet -- the Earth\index{weight}.\\
The weight $W$ of any object is proportional to its mass $m$: \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{W=mg}\end{empheq}

Where $g$ is strength of the gravitational field, or the gravitational acceleration constant, The value of $g \approx 9.81 \text{ N kg}^{-1}$ but this value for $g$ does not hold in a satellite orbit, on Mars, near a black hole, etc.


The concept of weight is different from mass in many aspects:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item[--] weight is a force, so it is a vector (always acting downwards still makes a direction)
	
	mass is a scalar, it has magnitude only
	
	\item[--] weight is measured in newtons, mass is measured in kilograms
	
	\item[--] weight of object depends on its mass but also strength of gravitational field
	
	mass is an intrinsic property of object, so does not depend on force fields
	
	same object can have different weights on different planets, but its mass will be the same\footnote{Here we do not take into account the effects of \emph{relativity}. A clever student who has learned Einstein's theories might suggest the mass of the same object increases with its velocity.}
\end{compactitem}

\example{An astronaut finds that he weighs 300 N on the surface of Mars, where the gravitational field strength is known to be $3.7 \text{ N kg}^{-1}$. Find his mass and hence estimate his weight if he returns to his home on the Earth.}

\begin{soln} Mass of astronaut: $m = \frac{W_M}{g_M} = \frac{300}{3.7} \approx 81.1 \text{ kg}$

Weight on earth: $W_E = mg_E = 81.1 \times 9.81 \approx 795 \text{ N}$ \end{soln}

\subsection*{Free fall}

All things on the earth fall because of the force of gravity, if we ignore the restraints such as air resistance and upthrust force on a falling object, say the object is under the influence of gravity only, then the object is in a state called \keypoint{free fall}. Assuming the object is subject to gravity only, the resultant force is simply its weight, applying the Newton's second law, we have $\fnet = W \RA ma = mg$ so acceleration of the freely-falling object is\footnote[][-5cm]{In the derivation, the mass terms cancel out. Rigorously speaking, these are two different masses. One is the measure of inertia, and the other is a measure of gravitational force. It is experimentally found that the inertia mass and the gravitational mass are equal. The fact that the two masses are equal has profound reasons. We have shown here acceleration of free fall equals gravitational field strength, but Albert Einstein’s suggests that it is actually impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field. This idea lies at the heart of his \emph{general theory of relativity}. Those who are interested in this topic are recommended to start from here and do some online researches.}: \begin{empheq}[box=\tcbhighmath]{equation*}{a=g}\end{empheq}

The above shows us that \keypoint{acceleration due to free fall} is simply equal to field strength $g$, so any object, regardless of its mass, has same acceleration due to free fall.\footnote{In \S\ref{ch_freefall} and \S\ref{ch:projectile}, the statement that acceleration of free fall is constant in absence of air resistance was asserted without further explanation. Now you know why.}


\subsection{Drag}

When a body moves through air, water or any fluid, it experiences resistance called drag force\index{drag}, factors that determine the value of fluid drag include:

\titem relative speed of the object to the fluid ($v\up \ra f\up$)

\titem cross section of the object ($A\up \ra f\up$)

\titem shape of the object (streamlined shape has smaller drag)

\titem density of the fluid ($\rho\up \ra f\up$)

but what determines the drag force is a complicated issue\footnote[][-4cm]{There are a few empirical formula for drag force, each of which is accurate under certain conditions.
	
For an object moving through a fluid at low speeds (\emph{laminar flow}, no turbulence occurs), the resistance it experiences is proportional to its speed: $f=bv$, where $b$ is some constant which depends on fluid viscosity and the effective cross-sectional area of the object.
	
If objects are moving at relative high speeds through the fluid such that \emph{turbulence} is produced behind the object, drag force is proportional to the speed squared: $ f = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_D A v^2$, where $\rho$ is the fluid's density, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, $C_D$ is a dimensionless quantity called the drag coefficient.}
in short, the drag force always acts in a direction to oppose relative motion of object through fluid.

\subsection*{Free fall through air}

\begin{marginfigure}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw[thick,blue,->] (0,0) -- (0,-2.5) node[right,black]{$mg$};
	\draw[thick,blue,->] (0,0) -- (0,1.5) node[right,black]{$f$};
	\draw[fill=gray!50] (0,0) circle (0.3);

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{marginfigure}

Let's consider an object falling through air from a very high tower, the forces acting are weight and air resistance (shown in the free-body diagram). The equation of motion for this falling object is:

{
	\centering
	
	$ \fnet = mg - f = ma $
	
}

As $v$ increases, air resistance $f$ increases, so net force $\fnet$ decreases, this means acceleration $a$ would decrease as object falls - i.e., speed will increase at a decreasing rate during the fall
\footnote[][7cm]{The velocity-time relation can be obtained for some simple models. Suppose air resistance is proportional to speed of the falling body, i.e., $f=bv$, then the equation of motion reads: $\fnet = m \frac{\dd v}{\dd t} = mg - bv$, where acceleration is written explicitly as the rate of change in velocity. With the initial conditions $v=0$ at $t=0$, we can solve this differential equation to obtain the speed of this falling object at any given time $t$:
\begin{equation*}
	\dd t = \frac{\dd v}{g - \frac{b}{m}v} \RA \int_0^t \dd t = \int_0^v \frac{\dd v}{g - \frac{b}{m}v} \end{equation*}
 \begin{equation*}\RA t = -\frac{m}{b} \ln \left(g - \frac{b}{m}v \right) \Bigg|_0^v = -\frac{m}{b} \ln \left( 1 - \frac{bv}{mg}\right)
\end{equation*}
	
Rearrange the terms, we find: 
\begin{equation*}v(t) = \frac{mg}{b} \left(1 - \ee^{-\frac{bt}{m}} \right)\end{equation*}}

%$v$-$t$ graph for this process is shown on the next page

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{variation of velocity for a falling object through air}
\end{figure*}
at low speeds, air resistance is negligible, so $\fnet =ma \approx mg$,  acceleration of object at start of the fall is similar to $g$ but as $v$ increases, acceleration decreases so $a$ becomes less than $g$. After a sufficiently long time, acceleration gradually decreases to zero, velocity gradually increases and tends to a maximum value. At this stage, equilibrium is restored: $f=mg$, object no longer accelerates, this constant final velocity is known as the \keypoint{terminal Velocity}\index{terminal velocity}


\example{An object of 5.0 kg falls through the atmosphere from a very high altitude. After some time, it falls at a constant speed of $70 \mps$. Assume there is no significant change in gravitational field during the fall and the air resistance is proportional to speed: $f=bv$. (a) Find the value of the coefficient $k$. (b) Find the acceleration of the object when it is falling at $30\mps$.}

\begin{soln}equilibrium between weight and air drag when falling at terminal speed, so
\begin{equation*}
	mg = bv_t \RA b = \frac{mg}{v_t} = \frac{5.0\times9.81}{70} \approx 0.70 \text{ kg s}^{-1}
\end{equation*}

at any instant, equation of motion is: $\fnet = ma = mg - bv$

at $30\mps$, acceleration is: $a = \frac{mg-bv}{m} = \frac{5.0\times9.81-0.70\times30}{5.0} \approx 5.6 \mpss$ \end{soln}

\subsection*{Bubble rising in a liquid}

	\draw[fill=gray!50] (0,0) circle (0.3);
	\draw[thick,purple,->] (1,-0.5) -- (1,0.5) node[right]{$v$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{marginfigure}

let's now consider bubbles formed at the bottom of a fizzy drink. The forces acting on bubble are weight, water resistance and upthrust. The equation of motion for the rising bubble is:

{
	\centering
	
	$ \fnet = U - mg - f = ma $
	
}

As bubble moves faster, $f$ increases, then $\fnet$ decreases, so acceleration $a$ would gradually decrease to zero as bubble rises. The speed of the bubble increases and reaches a maximum value at terminal speed, $a\to0$, therefore one has: $$U=f+mg$$




\subsection{Normal contact}

When two objects are in contact, the interaction between them is called the \emph{contact force}. The 
\keypoint{normal contact force} is the component of contact force perpendicular to the contacting surface.\sidenote[][]{By definition, "normal" is always at right angles to the surface in question. Cf. refraction and reflection.}

Of course, we know that there are actually only 4 forces in the universe so the origin of normal contact is the \emph{electrostatic interaction} between atoms. It's convenient shorthand however to be able to talk about contact and non-contact forces and it's \textit{close enough.}\footnote{Pun intended.} When two objects are pressed against each other, surface atoms get close enough that the strong electrostatic repulsion between electron clouds of the atoms prevent them from penetrating through one another.

\begin{soln} The forces acting on man are weight and normal contact, for either case, equation of motion for the man reads:

\subsection{Friction}

Friction is the component of contact force that is parallel to contact surfaces, when there is potential or actual sliding between surfaces, frictional force come into action\index{friction}

\titem for surfaces that \emph{tend} to move relative to each other, \keypoint{static friction} acts to oppose this tendency.

\titem if surfaces are already sliding over one another, then \keypoint{kinetic, or dynamic friction} opposes this motion.\footnote{\piste We dont need to know these in these terms - we often lump dynamic friction together with any other frictive forces, like air-resistance, and just call th resultant "Drag". Remember, a lot of Physics is knowing when to simplify.}

You could say that static friction $f_S$ is self-adjusting, in that it arises as an $N3^{rd}$ force and will always be equal to the applied force - up until the moment the capacity for static friction is exceeded\footnote{You'll learn about the coefficient of friction $\mu$ in maths}.
In other words, an object placed on a rough surface can stay at rest when acted by a small external force $F$ it can do so because $f_S$ equalises external force to maintain equilibrium, if no external force acts, then $f_S=0$

Friction, on microscopic level, is an \emph{electromagnetic force} in nature when two surfaces are in contact, irregularities on the surface touch each other surface atoms come very close and bonds are formed through electrostatic force in some sense, surface atoms get \emph{cold welded} to each other when surfaces try to move relative to each other, this electrostatic weld is origin of friction.

\subsection{Inclined slopes}\index{inclined slopes}

The inclined slope is probably the entry ticket into the business end of mechanics problems. There are \emph{hundreds} of examples of this notorious problem to be found in any physics textbook and any exam paper on mechanics.

The problem is about a mass $m$ placed on a plane inclined at angle $\theta$ to the horizontal, the mass could sit at rest on, slide down, or get pulled/pushed up the plane. The motion of the mass could be affected by weight, friction, normal contact, or other forces.\\
They almost all have the same trick - resolve the forces in directions parallel and perpendicular to the slope because this allows you to use the equations of motion to work out motion up or down the slope.
It is almost inevitable that you'll need to break weight into two components\footnote{We have already done that in Example \ref{ex:comp-of-W}.}

\titem component of weight parallel down the slope is: $W_\parallelslant = mg\sin\theta$

\titem component of weight perpendicular to slope is: $W_\perp = mg\cos\theta$

Note that component of weight down the slope is: $W_\parallelslant = mg\sin\theta = 3.0\times9.81\times18^\circ \approx 9.1 \text{ N}$

\subsection{Many-body problems}

The problems we have been dealing with so far only involve one body, however a lot of the "resolving vectors" type problems involve several objects that mutually interact. We can often exploit the fact that if you take any individual part of a system and look into the \textit{internal} forces between the objects of interest you'll find that any force acting between objects \emph{within} system, has an equal but opposite reaction force.\\
The system can also be treated as a whole and we can analyse the \textit{net external force} acting on entire system and work out any resultant or combined force/acceleration/etc.


\example{Two boxes $A$ and $B$ are placed on a smooth surface. They are accelerated together by a horizontal force $F$ as shown. Find the acceleration and the contact force between them.}

\subsection{Tension in ropes}
Tension, like the normal reaction force, is a useful shorthand that tells us a lot more about the situation than you might, as a new physicist, realise. The tension is a force along the length of a flexible medium, such as a rope or cable, it always acts both ways. To make that clearer, consider a person pulling a rope attached to a wall:

 \caption{Pulling a rope from a wall}

\end{figure}
The force on the rope from the person must be equal to the force on the person by the rope - from Newton's 3rd law. By the same logic, the force on the wall must be the same as the force exerted on the rope by the person.

A \emph{pulley} is basically a wheel that carries a string/rope/cable, in this section, we only consider pulleys whose axis of rotation is fixed, such pulleys can be used to change direction of tension in a taut string. We also assume pulleys to be \emph{ideal}: they have no mass and no friction\footnote{I really need a spherical cow icon, this will have to do: 
    \includegraphics[scale=.1]{sphericalcow.png}}
for an ideal pulley, tensions on both sides are equal: $T_1 = T_2$.

\example{Two blocks of mass $m_A$ and $m_B$ ($m_A>m_B$) are joined together by a light inextensible string. The string passes over a smooth pulley as shown. The two blocks are suddenly released from rest. Find the acceleration of each block and the tension in the string.}

\begin{soln}
    
Apply Newton's second law to each block:

{
	\centering
	
	$\left\{ \begin{array}{llll} \text{for $A$:} & m_Ag-T &=& m_Aa \\ \text{for $B$:} & T-m_Bg &=& m_Ba \end{array} \right.$
	
}

\vspace{0.4em} adding the two, one obtains equation of motion for whole system:

{
	\centering
	
	$ m_A g - m_B g = (m_A+m_B) a $
	
}

		
solving these equations, we find
\begin{equation*}
	a = \frac{m_A-m_B}{m_A+m_B}g \qquad T = \frac{2m_Am_Bg}{m_A+m_B} 
\end{equation*}
\end{soln}

\begin{soln}
  Apply Newton's second law to each mass:

{
	\centering
	
	$\left\{ \begin{array}{lcll} \text{for $M$:} & T &=& Ma \\ \text{for $m$:} & mg-T &=& ma \end{array} \right.$
	
}

\vspace{0.4em} adding the two equations, we have:

{
	\centering
	
	$ mg = (M+m) a $
	
}

so acceleration is:

{
	\centering
	
	$a = \frac{mg}{M+m} = \frac{2.0\times9.81}{4.0+2.0} = 3.27 \mpss$
	
}

tension in string: $T = Ma = 4.0 \times 3.27 \approx 13.1 \text{ N}$
