\subsection{magnets}\index{magnets}

magnetic effects are commonly seen in \emph{magnets}

a magnet creates a magnetic field that attracts or repels other magnets

\cmt polarity of magnets

a magnet has two poles, the \emph{north pole} and the \emph{south pole}

freely suspend a magnet, the north pole points towards earth's geographic north pole

when two magnets are brought near each other, like poles repel, and opposite poles attract

\cmt we use \keypoint{magnetic field lines}\index{field line!magnetic field line} to graphically represent how magnetic field permeate space

by convention, fields lines emerge from north pole and go into south pole

density of field lines shows strength of magnetic field

direction of field line tells how the north pole of a small compass will line up at that point

\cmt strength of the field is described by a quantity called \keypoint{magnetic flux density}, denoted by $B$

when we draw field lines, we are actually drawing the pattern of flux density $B$

the notion of flux density will be defined later in details in \S\ref{sec:magnetic_flux_density}

\subsection{magnetic field due to currents}
an electric current also induces a magnetic field around it

this was first discovered by Danish physicist \emph{Hans Christian Orsted} in 1820, when he noticed the turning of a compass needle placed next to a wire carrying current.

we will look into what happens when a current flows through a straight wire or a coil

\cmt pattern of the field can be determined using \keypoint{right-hand (grip) rule}\index{right-hand rule}\footnote{The awesome right-hand rule illustrations below are copied from the PSTricks web site: \url{http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=examples}. The credits for these figures are attributed to CTAN community member \emph{Thomas S\"{o}ll}.}

\caption*{field due to a circulating current}
\end{figure}

\cmt strength of the field is proportional to the current: $B \propto I$

for both straight wires
\footnote{The magnetic flux density generated by a current flowing in an infinitely long wire in free space is given by: $\boxed{B=\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}}$, $I$ is the electric current, $r$ is the perpendicular distance from the current, and $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T m A}^{-1}$ is a fundamental physical constant called the \emph{vacuum permeability}. \piste}
 and coils\footnote{The magnetic flux density at the centre of a current-carrying coil in free space is given by: $\boxed{B=\frac{\mu_0 NI}{L}}$, where $N$ is the number of turns, $I$ is the electric current flowing through the coil, $L$ is the length of coil, and $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability. \piste}
 , greater current means stronger field
 
\cmt strength of magnetic field can be increased with \emph{soft iron}

this is because \emph{ferromagnetic materials} (iron, cobalt, nickel) can attract magnetic field lines\footnote{If the straight wire is immersed in a material with \emph{relative permeability} $\mu_r$, then the field becomes: $B=\frac{\mu_0 \mu_r I}{2\pi r}$. Similarly, if a material with relative permeability $\mu_r$ is present, then the magnetic flux density inside a coil becomes: $B=\frac{\mu_0 \mu_r NI}{L}$. A good magnetic material (high permeability material), such as iron, has large $\mu_r$, and therefore can greatly intensify the magnetic field. \piste}

\subsection{solenoids \& electromagnets}

strength and polarity of the field due to a coil can be changed easily by tuning currents, so coils are widely used to create magnetic fields where needed

a current-carrying coil is also called a \keypoint{solenoid}

\subsection{magnetic force on current-carrying conductor}

\subsection{magnetic flux density} \label{sec:magnetic_flux_density}

rewrite $F=BIL\sin\theta$ as $B = \frac{F}{IL\sin\theta}$,we can now give a formal definition for flux density $B$:

\begin{ilight}
	\keypoint{magnetic flux density}\index{magnetic field!magnetic flux density} $B$ at a point is defined as the force acted per unit length on a conductor carrying a unit current at right angle to the magnetic field
\end{ilight}

\cmt flux density describes the strength of a magnetic field\footnote{Magnetic field strength is a different quantity, defined by $H=\frac{B}{\mu}$, with $\mu=\mu_0\mu_r$ being the \emph{magnetic permeability} of material. The naming of field strength $H$ and flux density $B$ are due to historical reasons.}

\cmt $B$ is measured in \keypoint{tesla}\index{tesla} (T)\footnote{Telsa is a very large unit. For example, the strength of a typical refrigerator magnet is of about $10^{-3} \text{ T}$, even the very strong superconducting coils used in MRI are of around $1\sim3 \text{ T}$.}: $[B]=\text{T}$, $1 \text{ T} = 1 \text{ N}\cdot\text{A}^{-1}\cdot\text{m}^{-1}$

\begin{ilight}
	if a wire of 1 m normal to the magnetic field that carries a current of $1\text{ A}$ experiences a force of $1\text{ N}$, then the magnetic flux density is $1\text{ T}$
\end{ilight}

\cmt $B$ is a \emph{vector} quantity, with both magnitude and direction


\example{A wire of 0.80 m carrying a current of 5.0 A is lying at right angles to a magnetic field, it experiences a force of 0.60 N, what is the flux density?}
	
\sol $B=\frac{F}{IL} = \frac{0.60}{5.0\times0.80} = 0.15 \text{ T} \quad $ (a field of over 0.1 T is actually quite strong!) \eoe

a rectangular frame lies in parallel with the field

$QR, PS \parallelslant B$, so no force acting on these two sides

$PQ, RS \perp B$, so there is magnetic force $F=BIL$

using left-hand rule, we find $F_{PQ}$ acts into the paper, $F_{RS}$ acts out of the paper

this is a pair of equal but opposite forces

they produce a torque about central axis of frame: $\tau=Fd=BILd$, causing the frame to rotate\footnote{This effect allows engineers to build \emph{electric motors}, such as those in electric vehicles, washing machines, blenders, etc.}\eoe

if we have two straight parallel wires carrying currents in the same direction

force acting on $I_2$ is due to magnetic field $B_1$ generated by $I_1$

from top view, $I_1$ creates a counter-clockwise $B_1$, so $I_2$ experiences an upward field

using left-hand rule, force acting on $I_2$ by $I_1$, denoted $F_{21}$\footnote{$F_{AB}$ denotes the force acted on object $A$ by object $B$.}, points to the left

since $F_{21}$ and $F_{12}$ are a pair of action-reaction, so $F_{12}$ points to the right

\subsection{magnetic force on charged particles}

electric currents are formed by moving charges, since current-carrying wires in a magnetic field experience force, charged particle moving in magnetic field should also experience force

\subsection{magnetic force on charged particles}

starting from $F=BIl\sin\theta$, let's substitute $I=nAqv \RA F=B(nAqv)l\sin\theta$

notice $n$ is the number density of charged particles, so $nAl$ together gives the total number

if we look at the force acting on \emph{one} charged particle, then $nAl=1$, so: $F=Bqv\sin\theta$\index{magnetic field!magnetic force}

\cmt magnitude of magnetic force on charged particle: $\boxed{F=Bqv\sin\theta}$ 

$B$ is magnetic flux density, $q$ is electric charge of the particle, $v$ is its velocity

$\theta$ refers to the angle between $B$ and $v$

	Fleming's left-hand rule
	\vspace*{-16pt}
\end{marginfigure}

\cmt direction of magnetic force can be determined using \emph{Fleming's left-hand rule}\index{left-hand rule}

for $+q$, current in same direction as $v$

for $-q$, current in opposite direction as $v$

\cmt force depends on \emph{perpendicular component} of $B$

if $v \perp B$, magnetic force $F=Bqv$

if $v \parallelslant B$, there is no magnetic force

when particle moves at angle $\theta$ to $B$, contribution to the force only comes from the \emph{perpendicular component}, giving rise to the $\sin\theta$ factor

\cmt magnetic force always perpendicular to both velocity $v$ and magnetic field $B$\footnote{Vector form of the formula: $\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$. \piste}

	circular motion of a charged particle in uniform magnetic field
\end{figure}

magnetic force $F_B$ always at right angle to motion, so $F_B$ keeps changing direction of velocity

uniform field means a constant force, so $F_B$ deflects the particle at the same rate

the particle should describe a \emph{circular} path!

\begin{ilight}
	for a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field, \emph{magnetic force provides centripetal force for circular motion}: $\boxed{Bqv = \frac{mv^2}{r}}$, or $\boxed{Bqv = m \omega^2 r}$
\end{ilight}

\cmt can solve for radius of the orbiting particles: $r=\frac{mv}{Bq}$

\begin{compactenum}

\item[-] $v\up \Rightarrow r\up$, faster particles take larger circles
	
\item[-] $B\up \Rightarrow r\down$, stronger magnetic field, larger centripetal force, smaller circles
	
\item[-] $m\up \Rightarrow r\up$, larger mass, larger inertia, so larger circles

\end{compactenum}
	
\cmt radius of curvature relates to charge-to-mass ratio (also called \emph{specific charge}\index{specific charge}) of the particle

rearrange the equation we have $\frac{q}{m}=\frac{v}{Br}$, which can be computed using experimental data

charged particles accelerated through an electric field: $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = qV$

they then enter a uniform magnetic field: $Bqv = \frac{mv^2}{r} \ra v=\frac{Bqr}{m}$ $\quad$

eliminating $v$: $v^2 = \frac{2qV}{m} = \frac{B^2 q^2 r^2}{m^2} \ra \frac{q}{m} = \frac{2V}{B^2 r^2}$

we can measure $V$, $B$, $r$ in practice, so the charge-to-mass ratio $\frac{q}{m}$ is worked out

since different particles usually have different values of $\frac{q}{m}$, so this technique is widely used to identify unknown particles

\end{figure}

the idea is to makes use of magnetic force to guide moving charges into a spiral path between accelerations by an electric field

as the particle enters and leaves the region of electric field, it gains extra energy of $qV$

it then follows a semi-circular path under magnetic force and re-enters the electric field

polarity of the electric field is reversed so the particle continues to accelerate across the gap

energy of particle increases by $qV$, it then moves in a larger semi-circle in magnetic field

repeat this process, the particle leaves the exit port with very high speed



\cmt cyclotron frequency

for charged particles circulating in a uniform magnetic field: $Bqv=m\omega^2 r$

time to complete one full turn is: $T=\frac{2\pi r}{v} = \frac{2\pi}{v}\times\frac{mv}{Bq}\ra T=\frac{2\pi m}{Bq}$

this shows the period is independent of radius of the circular path!

if an alternating voltage is applied at frequency $f=\frac{Bq}{2\pi m}$, particles can be accelerated continuously at just the right time when they cross the gap

this frequency is known as the \emph{cyclotron frequency}

\question{Protons are accelerated in a cyclotron where the uniform magnetic field region has a flux density of 1.5 T and the voltage between the gap is 20 kV.

suppose magnetic field goes upward, current flows to the right (see figure), then charge carriers (assumed to be electrons for now) experience a magnetic force pointing out of paper

this magnetic force causes a build-up of extra charge on front side of conductor, which produces an internal electric field $E$ inside conductor, i.e., a potential difference $V_H$ is formed

as charge carriers accumulate on one side, Hall voltage opposes further migration of charges

steady $V_H$ is established when magnetic force and electric force are balanced: $Eq = Bqv$

\begin{compactenum}
	\item[-] strength of internal electric field is related to Hall voltage: $E=\frac{V_H}{d}$
	
	where $d$ is width of the conductor
	
	\item[-] drift velocity $v$ of particles is related to current $I$: $I=nAqv$
	
	where $A$ is cross section of conductor and $n$ is number density of charge carriers
\end{compactenum}


we now have: $\frac{V_H}{d}q = Bq \frac{I}{nAq} \ra V_H = \frac{BId}{nAq}$

note that cross section $A=dt$, where $t$ is thickness of conductor as shown

we therefore obtain an useful expression for Hall voltage: $ V_H = \frac{BId}{n(td)q} \ra \boxed{V_H = \frac{BI}{ntq}}$ 

\cmt to produce noticeable $V_H$, we want smaller $n$ and smaller $t$

\begin{compactenum}
	\item[-] $n\downarrow \ra$ few free charge carriers $\ra$ \emph{semi-conductors} are preferable

	\item[-] $t\downarrow \ra$ small thickness $\ra$ \emph{thin slice} of component is preferable

\end{compactenum}

\cmt polarity of $V_H$ is determined by nature of charge carries
	
charge carriers can be \emph{free electrons} (negatively charged) or \emph{holes} (positively charged)
	
then Hall voltage induced would have opposite polarity

\cmt if current $I$ forms angle $\theta$ with flux density $B$, again only perpendicular component matters

expression for Hall voltage becomes: $V_H = \frac{BI}{ntq}\sin\theta$
	
\cmt apply a fixed current in a conductor, $V_H$ is proportional to $B$
	
so magnetic flux density can be calculated once we find $V_H$
	
one can make use of Hall effect to build a \emph{Hall probe}, a device used to measure flux density $B$

when using a Hall probe, one should rotate and record the greatest voltage reading to ensure the current applied is at right angle to the external magnetic field

\question{Why is it difficult to detect Hall voltage in a thin slice of copper?}

\question{A Hall probe is placed near to one end of a strong magnet. State and explain the variation in the Hall voltage as the probe is rotated for one complete revolution.}
